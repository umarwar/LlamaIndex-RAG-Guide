If you simply allow yourself to feel nervous, you'll do \nmuch better. Remember also that it's difficult for the interviewer as well.  \nIn general, be upbeat and positive. Never be negative.  \nRehearse your answers and time them. Never talk for more than 2 minutes straight.  \nDon't try to memorize answers word for word. Use the answers shown here as a guide \nonly, and don't be afraid to include your own thoughts and words. To help you remember \nkey concepts, jot down and review a few key words for each answer. Rehearse your \nanswers frequently, and they will come to you naturally in interviews.  \nAs you will read in the accompanying report, the single most important strategy in \ninterviewing, as in all phases of your job search, is what we call: \"The Greatest \nExecutive Job Finding Secret.\"  And that is...  \nFind out what people want, than show them how you can help them get it.  \nFind out what an employer wants most in his or her ideal candidate, then show how you \nmeet those qualifications.  \nIn other words, you must match your abilities, with the needs of the employer. You must \nsell what the buyer is buying. To do that, before you know what to emphasize in your \nanswers, you must find out what the buyer is buying... what he is looking for. And the \nbest way to do that is to ask a few questions yourself.  \nYou will see how to bring this off skillfully as you read the first two questions of this \nreport. But regardless of how you accomplish it, you must remember this strategy above \nall: before blurting out your qualifications, you must get some idea of what the employer \nwants most. Once you know what he wants, you can then present your qualifications as \nthe perfect \u201ckey\u201d that fits the \u201clock\u201d of that position.  \n\u2022 Other important interview strategies: \n\u2022 Turn weaknesses into strengths (You'll see how to do this in a few moments.)  \n\u2022 Think before you answer. A pause to collect your thoughts is a hallmark of a \nthoughtful person.  \nAs a daily exercise, practice being more optimistic. For example, try putting a positive \nspin on events and situations you would normally regard as negative. This is not meant \nto turn you into a Pollyanna, but to sharpen your selling skills. The best salespeople, as \nwell as the best liked interview candidates, come off as being naturally optimistic, \"can \ndo\" people. You will dramatically raise your level of attractiveness by daily practicing to \nbe more optimistic.  \nBe honest...never lie.  \n64 Toughest Questions  Page 3", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 2589, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd9eda11-bdf1-40cb-b3ee-221ca936da73": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd9eda11-bdf1-40cb-b3ee-221ca936da73", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "doc2.pdf", "file_path": "u:\\testLlamaIndex\\data\\doc2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 415008, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c80185df-1f81-4625-a9c2-4121973927f8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "doc2.pdf", "file_path": "u:\\testLlamaIndex\\data\\doc2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 415008, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "ad41c9dabad6c89e11a1dbb9618eaf06dba9c5cca2ba83dee37f4ceeccf79d8e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Keep an interview diary.

Many \ncandidates, unprepared for the question, skewer themselves by rambling, recapping \ntheir life story, delving into ancient work history or personal matters. \nBEST ANSWER:  Start with the present and tell why you are well qualified for the \nposition. Remember that the key to all successful interviewing is to match your \nqualifications to what the interviewer is looking for. In other words you must sell what the \nbuyer is buying. This is the single most important strategy in job hunting.  \nSo, before you answer this or any question it's imperative that you try to uncover your \ninterviewer's greatest need, want, problem or goal.  \nTo do so, make you take these two steps: \n1. Do all the homework you can before the interview to uncover this person's wants \nand needs (not the generalized needs of the industry or company) \n2. As early as you can in the interview, ask for a more complete description of what \nthe position entails.  You might say: \u201cI have a number of accomplishments I'd like \nto tell you about, but I want to make the best use of our time together and talk \ndirectly to your needs. To help me do, that, could you tell me more about the \nmost important priorities of this position?  All I know is what I (heard from the \nrecruiter, read in the classified ad, etc.)\u201d \n Then, ALWAYS follow-up with a second and possibly, third question, to draw out his \nneeds even more. Surprisingly, it's usually this second or third question that unearths \nwhat the interviewer is most looking for.  \nYou might ask simply, \"And in addition to that?...\" or, \"Is there anything else you see as \nessential to success in this position?:  \nThis process will not feel easy or natural at first, because it is easier simply to answer \nquestions, but only if you uncover the employer's wants and needs will your answers \nmake the most sense. Practice asking these key questions before giving your answers, \nthe process will feel more natural and you will be light years ahead of the other job \ncandidates you're competing with.  \nAfter uncovering what the employer is looking for, describe why the needs of this job \nbear striking parallels to tasks you've succeeded at before. Be sure to illustrate with \nspecific examples of your responsibilities and especially your achievements, all of which \nare geared to present yourself as a perfect match for the needs he has just described.  \n64 Toughest Questions  Page 5", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 2536, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a0c5716-a403-46ec-a0da-b99bcb9b1e7d": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a0c5716-a403-46ec-a0da-b99bcb9b1e7d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "doc2.pdf", "file_path": "u:\\testLlamaIndex\\data\\doc2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 415008, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3eb3dc9b-9aa4-4f49-ad18-681331897d01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "doc2.pdf", "file_path": "u:\\testLlamaIndex\\data\\doc2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 415008, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "5de7e80c2c03b2c08feb928f1a1ea4aa7d57af26d2e087062f501c58aeb77e45", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Question 2 What are your greatest strengths? \nTRAPS:  This question seems like a softball lob, but be prepared. You don't want to \ncome across as egotistical or arrogant. Neither is this a time to be humble.  \nBEST ANSWER:  You know that your key strategy is to first uncover your interviewer's \ngreatest wants and needs before you answer questions. And from Question 1, you know \nhow to do this.  \nPrior to any interview, you should have a list mentally prepared of your greatest \nstrengths. You should also have, a specific example or two, which illustrates each \nstrength, an example chosen from your most recent and most impressive achievements. \nYou should, have this list of your greatest strengths and corresponding examples from \nyour achievements so well committed to memory that you can recite them cold after \nbeing shaken awake at 2:30AM.  \nThen, once you uncover your interviewer's greatest wants and needs, you can choose \nthose achievements from your list that best match up.  \nAs a general guideline, the 10 most desirable traits that all employers love to see in their \nemployees are: \n1. A proven track record as an achiever... especially if your achievements match \nup with the employer's greatest wants and needs. \n2. Intelligence...management \"savvy\".  \n3. Honesty...integrity...a decent human being.  \n4. Good fit with corporate culture...someone to feel comfortable with...a team \nplayer who meshes well with interviewer's team. \n5.

I like to work with a sense of urgency \nand everyone is not always on the same wavelength.\u201d \nDrawback:  This strategy is better than admitting a flaw, but it's so widely used, it is \ntransparent to any experienced interviewer.  \n64 Toughest Questions  Page 6", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 2342, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ca6fc7d-8368-4c55-900a-ff19f900b872": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ca6fc7d-8368-4c55-900a-ff19f900b872", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "doc2.pdf", "file_path": "u:\\testLlamaIndex\\data\\doc2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 415008, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "514f9635-97c4-4741-bc31-c7bcb1e85064", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "doc2.pdf", "file_path": "u:\\testLlamaIndex\\data\\doc2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 415008, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "c87bdedead29ea4583bebfb12514a2c8603dcbea992876c3b81c34dbcd703cef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "BEST ANSWER:  (and another reason it's so important to get a thorough description of \nyour interviewer's needs before you answer questions): Assure the interviewer that you \ncan think of nothing that would stand in the way of your performing in this position with \nexcellence. Then, quickly review you strongest qualifications.  \nExample:  \u201cNobody's perfect, but based on what you've told me about this position, I \nbelieve I' d make an outstanding match. I know that when I hire people, I look for two \nthings most of all. Do they have the qualifications to do the job well, and the motivation \nto do it well?  Everything in my background shows I have both the qualifications and a \nstrong desire to achieve excellence in whatever I take on. So I can say in all honesty that \nI see nothing that would cause you even a small concern about my ability or my strong \ndesire to perform this job with excellence.\u201d \nAlternate strategy (if you don't yet know enough about the position to talk about such a \nperfect fit):  \nInstead of confessing a weakness, describe what you like most and like least, making \nsure that what you like most matches up with the most important qualification for \nsuccess in the position, and what you like least is not essential.  \nExample:  Let's say you're applying for a teaching position. \u201cIf given a choice, I like to \nspend as much time as possible in front of my prospects selling, as opposed to shuffling \npaperwork back at the office.  Of course, I long ago learned the importance of filing \npaperwork properly, and I do it conscientiously. But what I really love to do is sell (if your \ninterviewer were a sales manager, this should be music to his ears.) \nQuestion 4 Tell me about something you did \u2013 or failed to do \u2013 that \nyou now feel a little ashamed of. \nTRAPS:  There are some questions your interviewer has no business asking, and this is \none.  But while you may feel like answering, \u201cnone of your business,\u201d naturally you can\u2019t.  \nSome interviewers ask this question on the chance you admit to something, but if not, at \nleast they\u2019ll see how you think on your feet. \nSome unprepared candidates, flustered by this question, unburden themselves of guilt \nfrom their personal life or career, perhaps expressing regrets regarding a parent, \nspouse, child, etc.  All such answers can be disastrous. \nBEST ANSWER:  As with faults and weaknesses, never confess a regret.  But don\u2019t \nseem as if you\u2019re stonewalling either. \nBest strategy:  Say you harbor no regrets, then add a principle or habit you practice \nregularly for healthy human relations. \nExample:  Pause for reflection, as if the question never occurred to you.  Then say, \u201cYou \nknow, I really can\u2019t think of anything.\u201d  (Pause again, then add): \u201cI would add that as a \ngeneral management principle, I\u2019ve found that the best way to avoid regrets is to avoid \ncausing them in the first place.  I practice one habit that helps me a great deal in this \nregard.

This rule is inviolable:  never be negative.  Any mud you hurl \nwill only soil your suit. \nEspecially avoid words like \u201cpersonality clash\u201d, \u201cdidn\u2019t get along\u201d, or others which cast a \nshadow on your competence, integrity, or temperament. \nBEST ANSWER: \n(If you have a job presently) \nIf you\u2019re not yet 100% committed to leaving your present post, don\u2019t be afraid to say so.  \nSince you have a job, you are in a stronger position than someone who does not.  But \ndon\u2019t be coy either.  State honestly what you\u2019d be hoping to find in a new spot.  Of \ncourse, as stated often before, you answer will all the stronger if you have already \nuncovered what this position is all about and you match your desires to it. \n(If you do not presently have a job.) \nNever lie about having been fired.  It\u2019s unethical \u2013 and too easily checked.  But do try to \ndeflect the reason from you personally.  If your firing was the result of a takeover, \nmerger, division wide layoff, etc., so much the better. \nBut you should also do something totally unnatural that will demonstrate consummate \nprofessionalism.  Even if it hurts , describe your own firing \u2013 candidly, succinctly and \nwithout a trace of bitterness \u2013 from the company\u2019s point-of-view, indicating that you \ncould understand why it happened and you might have made the same decision \nyourself. \nYour stature will rise immensely and, most important of all, you will show you are healed \nfrom the wounds inflicted by the firing.  You will enhance your image as first-class \nmanagement material and stand head and shoulders above the legions of firing victims \nwho, at the slightest provocation, zip open their shirts to expose their battle scars and \ndecry the unfairness of it all. \nFor all prior positions: \nMake sure you\u2019ve prepared a brief reason for leaving.

Thank goodness most interviewers don\u2019t employ \nit.  It\u2019s normally used by those determined to see how you respond under stress.  Here\u2019s \nhow it works: \nYou answer an interviewer\u2019s question and then, instead of asking another, he just stares \nat you in a deafening silence. \nYou wait, growing a bit uneasy, and there he sits, silent as Mt. Rushmore, as if he \ndoesn\u2019t believe what you\u2019ve just said, or perhaps making you feel that you\u2019ve unwittingly \nviolated some cardinal rule of interview etiquette. \nWhen you get this silent treatment after answering a particularly difficult question , such \nas \u201ctell me about your weaknesses\u201d, its intimidating effect can be most disquieting, even \nto polished job hunters. \nMost unprepared candidates rush in to fill the void of silence, viewing prolonged, \nuncomfortable silences as an invitation to clear up the previous answer which has \nobviously caused some problem.  And that\u2019s what they do \u2013 ramble on, sputtering more \nand more information, sometimes irrelevant and often damaging, because they are \nsuddenly playing the role of someone who\u2019s goofed and is now trying to recoup.  But \nsince the candidate doesn\u2019t know where or how he goofed, he just keeps talking, \nshowing how flustered and confused he is by the interviewer\u2019s unmovable silence. \nBEST ANSWER:  Like a primitive tribal mask, the Silent Treatment loses all it power to \nfrighten you once you refuse to be intimidated.  If your interviewer pulls it, keep quiet \nyourself for a while and then ask, with sincere politeness and not a trace of sarcasm, \u201cIs \nthere anything else I can fill in on that point?\u201d  That\u2019s all there is to it. \nWhatever you do, don\u2019t let the Silent Treatment intimidate you into talking a blue streak, \nbecause you could easily talk yourself out of the position. \nQuestion 7 Why should I hire you? \nTRAPS:  Believe it or not, this is a killer question because so many candidates are \nunprepared for it.  If you stammer or adlib you\u2019ve blown it. \nBEST ANSWER:  By now you can see how critical it is to apply the overall strategy of \nuncovering the employer\u2019s needs before you answer questions.  If you know the \nemployer\u2019s greatest needs and desires, this question will give you a big leg up over other \ncandidates because you will give him better reasons for hiring you than anyone else is \nlikely to\u2026reasons tied directly to his needs. \nWhether your interviewer asks you this question explicitly or not, this is the most \nimportant question of your interview because he must answer this question favorably in \nis own mind before you will be hired.

As you\u2019ve \nsaid you need someone with a strong background in trade book sales.  This is where \nI\u2019ve spent almost all of my career, so I\u2019ve chalked up 18 years of experience exactly in \nthis area.

That is, they may feel a bit defensive about \nbeing \u201csecond best\u201d to the place you\u2019re coming from, worried that you may consider \nthem bush league. \nThis anxiety could well be there even though you\u2019ve done nothing to inspire it. You must \ngo out of your way to assuage such anxiety, even if it\u2019s not expressed, by putting their \nvirtues high on the list of exactly what you\u2019re looking for, providing credible reason for \nwanting these qualities. \nIf you do not express genuine enthusiasm for the firm, its culture, location, industry, etc., \nyou may fail to answer this \u201cAvis\u201d complex objection and, as a result, leave the \ninterviewer suspecting that a hot shot like you, coming from a Fortune 500 company in \nNew York, just wouldn\u2019t be happy at an unknown manufacturer based in Topeka, \nKansas. \nQuestion 11 Why do you want to work at our company? \nTRAPS:  This question tests whether you\u2019ve done any homework about the firm.  If you \nhaven\u2019t, you lose.  If you have, you win big. \nBEST ANSWER:   This question is your opportunity to hit the ball out of the park, thanks \nto the in-depth research you should do before any interview. \nBest sources for researching your target company:  annual reports, the corporate \nnewsletter, contacts you know at the company or its suppliers, advertisements, articles \nabout the company in the trade press. \nQuestion 12 What are your career options right now? \nTRAPS:  The interviewer is trying to find out, \u201cHow desperate are you?\u201d \nBEST ANSWER:  Prepare for this question by thinking of how you can position yourself \nas a desired commodity.

You don\u2019t want to \nseem like damaged goods. \nBEST ANSWER:  You want to emphasize factors which have prolonged your job search \nby your own choice. \nExample: \u201cAfter my job was terminated, I made a conscious decision not to jump on the \nfirst opportunities to come along.  In my life, I\u2019ve found out that you can always turn a \nnegative into a positive IF you try hard enough. This is what I determined to do.

DON\u2019T  \nBEST ANSWER:  Remember the rule:  Never be negative.  Stress only the good points, \nno matter how charmingly you\u2019re invited to be critical. \nYour interviewer doesn\u2019t care a whit about your previous boss.  He wants to find out how \nloyal and positive you are, and whether you\u2019ll criticize him behind his back if pressed to \ndo so by someone in this own company.

Yet \nyou don\u2019t want to seem like a dullard who hasn\u2019t read a book since Tom Sawyer. \nBEST ANSWER:  Unless you\u2019re up for a position in academia or as book critic for The \nNew York Times, you\u2019re not expected to be a literary lion.  But it wouldn\u2019t hurt to have \nread a handful of the most recent and influential books in your profession and on \nmanagement. \nConsider it part of the work of your job search to read up on a few of these leading \nbooks.  But make sure they are quality books that reflect favorably upon you, nothing \nthat could even remotely be considered superficial.  Finally, add a recently published \nbestselling work of fiction by a world-class author and you\u2019ll pass this question with flying \ncolors. \nQuestion 16 Tell me about a situation when your work was \ncriticized. \nTRAPS:  This is a tough question because it\u2019s a more clever and subtle way to get you \nto admit to a weakness.  You can\u2019t dodge it by pretending you\u2019ve never been criticized.  \nEverybody has been.  Yet it can be quite damaging to start admitting potential faults and \nfailures that you\u2019d just as soon leave buried. \nThis question is also intended to probe how well you accept criticism and direction. \nBEST ANSWERS:  Begin by emphasizing the extremely positive feedback you\u2019ve gotten \nthroughout your career and (if it\u2019s true) that your performance reviews have been \nuniformly excellent. \nOf course, no one is perfect and you always welcome suggestions on how to improve \nyour performance.  Then, give an example of a not-too-damaging learning experience \nfrom early in your career and relate the ways this lesson has since helped you.  This \ndemonstrates that you learned from the experience and the lesson is now one of the \nstrongest breastplates in your suit of armor. \nIf you are pressed for a criticism from a recent position, choose something fairly trivial \nthat in no way is essential to your successful performance.  Add that you\u2019ve learned from \nthis, too, and over the past several years/months, it\u2019s no longer an area of concern \nbecause you now make it a regular practice to\u2026etc. \nAnother way to answer this question would be to describe your intention to broaden your \nmaster of an area of growing importance in your field.  For example, this might be a \ncomputer program you\u2019ve been meaning to sit down and learn\u2026 a new management \ntechnique you\u2019ve read about\u2026or perhaps attending a seminar on some cutting-edge \nbranch of your profession. \nAgain, the key is to focus on something not essential to your brilliant performance but \nwhich adds yet another dimension to your already impressive knowledge base. \n64 Toughest Questions  Page 14", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 2784, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ff36eb7-f2f5-4bc6-b10e-0025167b9153": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ff36eb7-f2f5-4bc6-b10e-0025167b9153", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "doc2.pdf", "file_path": "u:\\testLlamaIndex\\data\\doc2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 415008, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "54d32c86-50b5-4b96-b4cd-2800d63ebed0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "doc2.pdf", "file_path": "u:\\testLlamaIndex\\data\\doc2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 415008, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "fad20ac31792ecb5117406cb8d8182991ebbf4848e40f653c9ed3ec8730ba2b6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Question 17 What are your outside interests? \nTRAPS:  You want to be a well-rounded, not a drone.  But your potential employer \nwould be even more turned off if he suspects that your heavy extracurricular load will \ninterfere with your commitment to your work duties. \nBEST ANSWERS:  Try to gauge how this company\u2019s culture would look upon your \nfavorite outside activities and be guided accordingly. \nYou can also use this question to shatter any stereotypes that could limit your chances.  \nIf you\u2019re over 50, for example, describe your activities that demonstrate physical \nstamina.  If you\u2019re young, mention an activity that connotes wisdom and institutional \ntrust, such as serving on the board of a popular charity. \nBut above all, remember that your employer is hiring your for what you can do for him, \nnot your family, yourself or outside organizations, no matter how admirable those \nactivities may be. \nQuestion 18 The \u201cFatal Flaw\u201d question \nTRAPS:  If an interviewer has read your resume carefully, he may try to zero in on a \n\u201cfatal flaw\u201d of your candidacy, perhaps that you don\u2019t have a college degree\u2026you\u2019ve \nbeen out of the job market for some time\u2026you never earned your CPA, etc. \nA fatal flaw question can be deadly, but usually only if you respond by being overly \ndefensive. \nBEST ANSWERS:  As every master salesperson knows, you will encounter objections \n(whether stated or merely thought) in every sale.  They\u2019re part and parcel of the buyer\u2019s \nanxiety.  The key is not to exacerbate the buyer\u2019s anxiety but diminish it.  Here\u2019s how\u2026 \nWhenever you come up against a fatal flaw question:  \n1. Be completely honest, open and straightforward about admitting the \nshortcoming.  (Showing you have nothing to hide diminishes the buyer\u2019s \nanxiety.) \n2. Do not apologize or try to explain it away.  You know that this supposed flaw \nis nothing to be concerned about, and this is the attitude you want your \ninterviewer to adopt as well. \n3. Add that as desirable as such a qualification might be, its lack has made you \nwork all the harder throughout your career and has not prevented you from \ncompiling an outstanding tack record of achievements.  You might even give \nexamples of how, through a relentless commitment to excellence, you have \nconsistently outperformed those who do have this qualification.  \nOf course, the ultimate way to handle \u201cfatal flaw\u201d questions is to prevent them from \narising in the first place.  You will do that by following the master strategy described in \nQuestion 1, i.e., uncovering the employers needs and them matching your qualifications \nto those needs. \n64 Toughest Questions  Page 15", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 2642, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9dd67561-47f7-4824-b6c5-bd060c0310b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "9dd67561-47f7-4824-b6c5-bd060c0310b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "doc2.pdf", "file_path": "u:\\testLlamaIndex\\data\\doc2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 415008, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e47dc4d4-16b6-4113-9660-9177f38cb299", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "doc2.pdf", "file_path": "u:\\testLlamaIndex\\data\\doc2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 415008, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "da1e36d22bac4c431136a6a60c96989851fb5c6fc318b3847c9db628eb2513a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Once you\u2019ve gotten the employer to start talking about his most urgently-felt wants and \ngoals for the position, and then help him see in step-by-step fashion how perfectly your \nbackground and achievements match up with those needs, you\u2019re going to have one \nvery enthusiastic interviewer on your hands, one who is no longer looking for \u201cfatal \nflaws\u201d. \nQuestion 19 How do you feel about reporting to a younger person \n(minority, woman, etc)? \nTRAPS:  It\u2019s a shame that some interviewers feel the need to ask this question, but \nmany understand the reality that prejudices still exist among some job candidates, and \nit\u2019s better to try to flush them out beforehand. \nThe trap here is that in today\u2019s politically sensitized environment, even a well-intentioned \nanswer can result in planting your foot neatly in your mouth.  Avoid anything which \nsmacks of a patronizing or an insensitive attitude, such as \u201cI think they make terrific \nbosses\u201d or \u201cHey, some of my best friends are\u2026\u201d \nOf course, since almost anyone with an IQ above room temperature will at least try to \nsteadfastly affirm the right answer here, your interviewer will be judging your sincerity \nmost of all.  \u201cDo you really feel that way?\u201d is what he or she will be wondering. \nSo you must make your answer believable and not just automatic.  If the firm is wise \nenough to have promoted peopled on the basis of ability alone, they\u2019re likely quite proud \nof it, and prefer to hire others who will wholeheartedly share their strong sense of fair \nplay.  \nBEST ANSWER:  You greatly admire a company that hires and promotes on merit alone \nand you couldn\u2019t agree more with that philosophy.  The age (gender, race, etc.) of the \nperson you report to would certainly make no difference to you. \nWhoever has that position has obviously earned it and knows their job well.  Both the \nperson and the position are fully deserving of respect.  You believe that all people in a \ncompany, from the receptionist to the Chairman, work best when their abilities, efforts \nand feelings are respected and rewarded fairly, and that includes you.  That\u2019s the best \ntype of work environment you can hope to find. \nQuestion 20 On confidential matters\u2026 \nTRAPS:  When an interviewer presses you to reveal confidential information about a \npresent or former employer, you may feel it\u2019s a no-win situation.  If you cooperate, you \ncould be judged untrustworthy.  If you don\u2019t, you may irritate the interviewer and seem \nobstinate, uncooperative or overly suspicious. \nBEST ANSWER:  Your interviewer may press you for this information for two reasons. \nFirst, many companies use interviews to research the competition.  It\u2019s a perfect set-up.  \nHere in their own lair, is an insider from the enemy camp who can reveal prized \ninformation on the competition\u2019s plans, research, financial condition, etc. \n64 Toughest Questions  Page 16", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 2876, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3ab1e0f-5b4f-4b18-a02f-fee5adf867e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3ab1e0f-5b4f-4b18-a02f-fee5adf867e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "doc2.pdf", "file_path": "u:\\testLlamaIndex\\data\\doc2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 415008, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "17360211-6e05-4b9d-805e-2665a2e6d075", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "doc2.pdf", "file_path": "u:\\testLlamaIndex\\data\\doc2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 415008, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "52eb3228bfc4cfb636edcd81f5210fa1be49089c8f7546bb6f74a3f607be16bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Second, the company may be testing your integrity to see if you can be cajoled or bullied \ninto revealing confidential data. \nWhat to do?  The answer here is easy.  Never reveal anything truly confidential about a \npresent or former employer.  By all means, explain your reticence diplomatically.  For \nexample, \u201cI certainly want to be as open as I can about that.  But I also wish to respect \nthe rights of those who have trusted me with their most sensitive information, just as you \nwould hope to be able to trust any of your key people when talking with a competitor\u2026\u201d \nAnd certainly you can allude to your finest achievements in specific ways that don\u2019t \nreveal the combination to the company safe. \nBut be guided by the golden rule.  If you were the owner of your present company, would \nyou feel it ethically wrong for the information to be given to your competitors?  If so, \nsteadfastly refuse to reveal it. \nRemember that this question pits your desire to be cooperative against your integrity.  \nFaced with any such choice, always choose integrity.  It is a far more valuable \ncommodity than whatever information the company may pry from you.  Moreover, once \nyou surrender the information, your stock goes down.  They will surely lose respect for \nyou. \nOne President we know always presses candidates unmercifully for confidential \ninformation. If he doesn\u2019t get it, he grows visibly annoyed, relentlessly inquisitive,  It\u2019s all \nan act.  He couldn\u2019t care less about the information.

This question can derail your candidacy faster than a bomb on the \ntracks \u2013 and just as you are about to be hired. \nReason:  No matter how bright you are, you cannot know the right actions to take in a \nposition before you settle in and get to know the operation\u2019s strengths, weaknesses key \npeople, financial condition, methods of operation, etc.  If you lunge at this temptingly \nbaited question, you will probably be seen as someone who shoots from the hip. \nMoreover, no matter how comfortable you may feel with your interviewer, you are still an \noutsider.

But what if \nyou have a family and want to work a reasonably normal schedule?  Is there a way to \nget both the job and the schedule you want? \nBEST ANSWER:  First, if you\u2019re a confirmed workaholic, this question is a softball lob.  \nWhack it out of the park on the first swing by saying this kind of schedule is just your \nstyle.  Add that your family understands it.  Indeed, they\u2019re happy for you, as they know \nyou get your greatest satisfaction from your work. \nIf however, you prefer a more balanced lifestyle, answer this question with another:  \n\u201cWhat\u2019s the norm for your best people here?\u201d \nIf the hours still sound unrealistic for you, ask, \u201cDo you have any top people who perform \nexceptionally for you, but who also have families and like to get home in time to see \nthem at night?\u201d  Chances are this company does, and this associates you with this other \n\u201ctop-performers-who-leave-not-later-than-six\u201d group. \nDepending on the answer, be honest about how you would fit into the picture.  If all \nthose extra hours make you uncomfortable, say so, but phrase your response positively. \nExample:  \u201cI love my work and do it exceptionally well.  I think the results speak for \nthemselves, especially in \u2026(mention your two or three qualifications of greater interest \nto the employer.  Remember, this is what he wants most, not a workaholic with weak \ncredentials).  Not only would I bring these qualities, but I\u2019ve built my whole career on \nworking not just hard, but smart.  I think you\u2019ll find me one of the most productive people \nhere. \nI do have a family who likes to see me after work and on weekends.

You strategy here is to get the best offer you can, then \nmake a judgment whether it\u2019s worth it to you to relocate or travel. \nAlso, by the time the offer comes through, you may have other offers and can make a \nmore informed decision.  Why kill of this opportunity before it has chance to blossom into \nsomething really special?  And if you\u2019re a little more desperate three months from now, \nyou might wish you hadn\u2019t slammed the door on relocating or traveling. \nThe second way to handle this question is to voice a reservation, but assert that you\u2019d \nbe open to relocating (or traveling) for the right opportunity. \nThe answering strategy you choose depends on how eager you are for the job.

Why?  Because its real intent is \nnot just to see if you\u2019ve got the stomach to fire, but also to uncover poor judgment in \nhiring which has caused you to fire so many.  Also, if you fire so often, you could be a \ntyrant. \nSo don\u2019t rise to the bait by boasting how many you\u2019ve fired, unless you\u2019ve prepared to \nexplain why it was beyond your control, and not the result of your poor hiring procedures \nor foul temperament. \n64 Toughest Questions  Page 23", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 2452, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2537a2f8-52bd-42aa-920c-8c2bdf89e43e": {"__data__": {"id_": "2537a2f8-52bd-42aa-920c-8c2bdf89e43e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "doc2.pdf", "file_path": "u:\\testLlamaIndex\\data\\doc2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 415008, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1c04f6f0-eb65-479f-9aa2-cb9bdbce4693", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "doc2.pdf", "file_path": "u:\\testLlamaIndex\\data\\doc2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 415008, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "d694c0d73222de89bea8eb4fdd16c3cdf0da2de2beeda0e869d1e258db235a32", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "BEST ANSWER:    Describe the rational and sensible management process you follow \nin both hiring and firing. \nExample:  \u201cMy whole management approach is to hire the best people I can find, train \nthem thoroughly and well, get them excited and proud to be part of our team, and then \nwork with them to achieve our goals together.  If you do all of that right, especially hiring \nthe right people, I\u2019ve found you don\u2019t have to fire very often. \n\u201cSo with me, firing is a last resort.  But when it\u2019s got to be done, it\u2019s got to be done, and \nthe faster and cleaner, the better.  A poor employee can wreak terrible damage in \nundermining the morale of an entire team of good people.

If there are several entries on your resume of less \nthan one year, consider eliminating the less important ones.  Perhaps you can specify \nthe time you spent at previous positions in rounded years not in months and years.   \nExample:   Instead of showing three positions this way: \n6/1982 \u2013 3/1983, Position A; \n4/1983 \u2013 12/1983, Position B; \n1/1984 \u2013 8/1987, Position C;  \n\u2026it would be better to show simply: \n1982 \u2013 1983, Position A; \n1984 \u2013 1987 Position C. \nIn other words, you would drop Position B altogether.  Notice what a difference this \nmakes in reducing your image as a job hopper. \nOnce in front of the interviewer and this question comes up, you must try to reassure \nhim.  Describe each position as part of an overall pattern of growth and career \ndestination. \nBe careful not to blame other people for your frequent changes.  But you can and should \nattribute certain changes to conditions beyond your control.   \nExample:  Thanks to an upcoming merger, you wanted to avoid an ensuing bloodbath, \nso you made a good, upward career move before your department came under the axe \nof the new owners. \n64 Toughest Questions  Page 24", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 2321, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8f4d4a9-7034-48f6-b0a9-638e49b7f68e": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8f4d4a9-7034-48f6-b0a9-638e49b7f68e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "doc2.pdf", "file_path": "u:\\testLlamaIndex\\data\\doc2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 415008, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1d7be04e-896f-44ae-879c-40c1257db53d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "doc2.pdf", "file_path": "u:\\testLlamaIndex\\data\\doc2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 415008, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "d9060dda447dd43c0978870ecc36eb7e6c881b75a588414d458100e0fce8f54b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "If possible, also show that your job changes were more frequent in your younger days, \nwhile you were establishing yourself, rounding out your skills and looking for the right \ncareer path.

Handle it wrong and you can \nblow the job offer or go to work at far less than you might have gotten. \nBEST ANSWER:  For maximum salary negotiating power, remember these five \nguidelines: \n1. Never bring up salary.  Let the interviewer do it first.  Good salespeople sell their \nproducts thoroughly before talking price.  So should you.  Make the interviewer \nwant you first, and your bargaining position will be much stronger. \n2. If your interviewer raises the salary question too early, before you\u2019ve had a \nchance to create desire for your qualifications, postpone the question, saying \nsomething like, \u201cMoney is important to me, but is not my main concern.  \nOpportunity and growth are far more important.  What I\u2019d rather do, if you don\u2019t \nmind, is explore if I\u2019m right for the position, and then talk about money. Would \nthat be okay?\u201d \n3. The #1 rule of any negotiation is:  the side with more information wins.  After \nyou\u2019ve done a thorough job of selling the interviewer and it\u2019s time to talk salary, \nthe secret is to get the employer talking about what he\u2019s willing to pay before you \nreveal what you\u2019re willing to accept.  So, when asked about salary, respond by \nasking, \u201cI\u2019m sure the company has already established a salary range for this \nposition.  Could you tell me what that is?\u201d  Or, \u201cI want an income commensurate \nwith my ability and qualifications.  I trust you\u2019ll be fair with me.  What does the \nposition pay?\u201d Or, more simply, \u201cWhat does this position pay?\u201d \n4. Know beforehand what you\u2019d accept.  To know what\u2019s reasonable, research the \njob market and this position for any relevant salary information.  Remember that \nmost executives look for a 20-25%$ pay boost when they switch jobs. If you\u2019re \ngrossly underpaid, you may want more. \n5. Never lie about what you currently make, but feel free to include the estimated \ncost of all your fringes, which could well tack on 25-50% more to your present \n\u201ccash-only\u201d salary. \nQuestion 55 The Illegal Question \nTRAPS:  Illegal questions include any regarding your age\u2026number and ages of your \nchildren or other dependents\u2026marital status\u2026maiden name\u2026religion\u2026political \naffiliation\u2026ancestry\u2026national origin\u2026birthplace\u2026naturalization of your parents, spouse \nor children\u2026diseases\u2026disabilities\u2026clubs\u2026or spouse\u2019s occupation\u2026 unless any of the \nabove are directly related to your performance of the job.

First, you can assert your legal right \nnot to answer. But this will frighten or embarrass your interviewer and destroy any \nrapport you had. \nSecond, you could swallow your concerns over privacy and answer the question straight \nforwardly if you feel the answer could help you.  For example, your interviewer, a devout \nBaptist, recognizes you from church and mentions it. Here, you could gain by talking \nabout your church. \nThird, if you don\u2019t want your privacy invaded, you can diplomatically answer the concern \nbehind the question without answering the question itself. \nExample:  If you are over 50 and are asked, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d you can answer with a \nfriendly, smiling question of your own on whether there\u2019s a concern that your age my \naffect your performance.  Follow this up by reassuring the interviewer that there\u2019s \nnothing in this job you can\u2019t do and, in fact, your age and experience are the most \nimportant advantages you offer the employer for the following reasons\u2026 \nAnother example:  If asked, \u201cDo you plan to have children?\u201d you could answer, \u201cI am \nwholeheartedly dedicated to my career\u201c, perhaps adding, \u201cI have no plans regarding \nchildren.\u201d  (You needn\u2019t fear you\u2019ve pledged eternal childlessness.  You have every right \nto change your plans later.  Get the job first and then enjoy all your options.) \nMost importantly, remember that illegal questions arise from fear that you won\u2019t perform \nwell.  The best answer of all is to get the job and perform brilliantly. All concerns and \nfears will then varnish, replaced by respect and appreciation for your work. \nQuestion 56 The \u201cSecret\u201d Illegal Question \nTRAPS:  Much more frequent than the Illegal question (see Question 55) is the secret \nillegal question.  It\u2019s secret because it\u2019s asked only in the interviewer\u2019s mind.  Since it\u2019s \nnot even expressed to you, you have no way to respond to it, and it can there be most \ndamaging. \nExample:  You\u2019re physically challenged, or a single mother returning to your professional \ncareer, or over 50, or a member of an ethnic minority, or fit any of a dozen other \ncategories that do not strictly conform to the majority in a given company. \nYour interviewer wonders, \u201cIs this person really able to handle the job?\u201d\u2026\u201dIs he or she a \n\u2018good fit\u2019 at a place like ours?\u201d\u2026\u201dWill the chemistry ever be right with someone like this?\u201d  \nBut the interviewer never raises such questions because they\u2019re illegal.  So what can \nyou do? \nBEST ANSWER:  Remember that just because the interviewer doesn\u2019t ask an illegal \nquestion doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t have it.  More than likely, he is going to come up with \nhis own answer.

Make sure, without in \nany way seeming defensive about yourself that you mention strengths, \naccomplishments, preferences and affiliations that strongly counterbalance any \nunspoken concern your interviewer may have. \nQuestion 57 What was the toughest part of your last job? \nTRAPS: This is slightly different from the question raised earlier, \u201cWhat\u2019s the most \ndifficult part of being a (job title\u2026)\u201d  because this asks what you personally have found \nmost difficult in your last position.  This question is more difficult to redefine into \nsomething positive.  Your interviewer will assume that whatever you found toughest may \ngive you a problem in your new position. \nBEST ANSWER:  State that there was nothing in your prior position that you found \noverly difficult, and let your answer go at that.  If pressed to expand your answer, you \ncould describe the aspects of the position you enjoyed more than others, making sure \nthat you express maximum enjoyment for those tasks most important to the open \nposition, and you enjoyed least those tasks that are unimportant to the position at hand. \nQuestion 58 How do you define success\u2026and how do you measure \nup to your own definition? \nTRAPS:  Seems like an obvious enough question.  Yet many executives, unprepared for \nit, fumble the ball. \nBEST ANSWER:  Give a well-accepted definition of success that leads right into your \nown stellar collection of achievements. \nExample:  \u201cThe best definition I\u2019ve come across is that success is the progressive \nrealization of a worthy goal.\u201d \n\u201cAs to how I would measure up to that definition, I would consider myself both successful \nand fortunate\u2026\u201d(Then summarize your career goals and how your achievements have \nindeed represented a progressive path toward realization of your goals.) \n64 Toughest Questions  Page 35", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 2745, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a69c6f74-bab1-4f70-a335-b3611d020788": {"__data__": {"id_": "a69c6f74-bab1-4f70-a335-b3611d020788", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "doc2.pdf", "file_path": "u:\\testLlamaIndex\\data\\doc2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 415008, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f0b12435-0a62-4616-be2d-56bd6895b3fe", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "doc2.pdf", "file_path": "u:\\testLlamaIndex\\data\\doc2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 415008, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "e5b9cb4109177f7b39faea5a08a3b4d355496f78f133ce7d20560214ef341f64", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Question 59 \u201cThe Opinion Question\u201d \u2013 What do you think about \n\u2026Abortion\u2026The President \u2026The Death Penalty\u2026(or \nany other controversial subject)? \nTRAPS:  Obviously, these and other \u201copinion\u201d questions should never be asked.  \nSometimes they come up over a combination dinner/interview when the interviewer has \nhad a drink or two, is feeling relaxed, and is spouting off about something that bugged \nhim in today\u2019s news.  If you give your opinion and it\u2019s the opposite of his, you won\u2019t \nchange his opinions, but you could easily lose the job offer. \nBEST ANSWER:  In all of these instances, just remember the tale about student and the \nwise old rabbi.  The scene is a seminary, where an overly serious student is pressing the \nrabbi to answer the ultimate questions of suffering, life and death.  But no matter how \nhard he presses, the wise old rabbi will only answer each difficult question with a \nquestion of his own. \nIn exasperation, the seminary student demands, \u201cWhy, rabbi, do you always answer a \nquestion with another question?\u201d  To which the rabbi responds, \u201cAnd why not?\u201d \nIf you are ever uncomfortable with any question, asking a question in return is the \ngreatest escape hatch ever invented.  It throws the onus back on the other person, \nsidetracks the discussion from going into an area of risk to you, and gives you time to \nthink of your answer or, even better, your next question! \nIn response to any of the \u201copinion\u201d questions cited above, merely responding, \u201cWhy do \nyou ask?\u201d will usually be enough to dissipate any pressure to give your opinion.  But if \nyour interviewer again presses you for an opinion, you can ask another question. \nOr you could assert a generality that almost everyone would agree with.  For example, if \nyour interviewer is complaining about politicians then suddenly turns to you and asks if \nyou\u2019re a Republican or Democrat, you could respond by saying, \u201cActually, I\u2019m finding it \nhard to find any politicians I like these days.\u201d \n(Of course, your best question of all may be whether you want to work for someone \nopinionated.) \nQuestion 60 If you won $10 million lottery, would you still work? \nTRAPS:  Your totally honest response might be, \u201cHell, no, are you serious?\u201d  That might \nbe so, but any answer which shows you as fleeing work if given the chance could make \nyou seem lazy.  On the other hand, if you answer, \u201cOh, I\u2019d want to keep doing exactly \nwhat I am doing, only doing it for your firm,\u201d you could easily inspire your interviewer to \nsilently mutter to himself, \u201cYeah, sure.  Gimme a break.\u201d \nBEST ANSWER:  This type of question is aimed at getting at your bedrock attitude \nabout work and how you feel about what you do.  Your best answer will focus on your \npositive feelings. \n64 Toughest Questions  Page 36", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 2780, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8aaf940-c1c8-47a8-bb86-ffdc54349dc6": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8aaf940-c1c8-47a8-bb86-ffdc54349dc6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "doc2.pdf", "file_path": "u:\\testLlamaIndex\\data\\doc2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 415008, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a7a8381-514e-4014-ba7e-a2a9853f8ca2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "doc2.pdf", "file_path": "u:\\testLlamaIndex\\data\\doc2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 415008, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "0fb287dfc0a250b70593b360751d24d820da2f36fd31ea74552987d7846ee516", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Example:  \u201cAfter I floated down from cloud nine, I think I would still hold my basic belief \nthat achievement and purposeful work are essential to a happy, productive life.

It represents the interviewer\u2019s \nown dilemma over this common problem.  He\u2019s probably leaning toward you already and \nfor reassurance, wants to hear what you have to say on the matter. \nBEST ANSWER:  Help him see the qualifications that only you can offer. \nExample:  \u201cIn general, I think it\u2019s a good policy to hire from within \u2013 to look outside \nprobably means you\u2019re not completely comfortable choosing someone from inside. \n\u201cNaturally, you want this department to be as strong as it possibly can be, so you want \nthe strongest candidate.
